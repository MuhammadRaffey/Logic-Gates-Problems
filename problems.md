# Logic Gate Real-Life Scenario Questions

1. **Security System Design:**
   You are designing a security system for a house where the alarm should sound if either the front door is opened or a window is broken, but not if both happen simultaneously (to prevent false alarms due to wind). Which logic gate(s) would you use, and how would you construct this system?

2. **Traffic Light Control:**
   Design a traffic light control system for an intersection with sensors. The light should turn green if there is a car on either side of the intersection but not if cars are on both sides. Which logic gate(s) will you use to achieve this?

3. **Smart Home Lighting:**
   In a smart home, you want the living room light to turn on if either the main door or the motion sensor is triggered, but not if both are triggered simultaneously (to save energy). How would you design this using logic gates?

4. **Emergency Power System:**
   Design an emergency power system where the backup generator starts if either the main power supply fails or the battery level is below a certain threshold, but not if both conditions are met (to avoid overloading). What logic gates would you use for this configuration?

5. **Automated Irrigation System:**
   Create an automated irrigation system that waters the garden if the soil moisture is low or if the weather forecast predicts no rain, but not if both conditions are met (to prevent over-watering). Which logic gates will you use, and how will you set this up?

6. **Access Control System:**
   You need to design an access control system for a restricted area where the door unlocks only if a valid ID card is swiped and the security code is entered correctly. What logic gates will you use to ensure both conditions are met?

7. **Fire Alarm System:**
   Design a fire alarm system that activates if either smoke is detected or the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, but not if both sensors are triggered (to avoid false alarms due to cooking). How would you use logic gates in this design?

8. **Home Automation for Energy Efficiency:**
   Create a system where the air conditioning turns on if the temperature is high or if the humidity is high, but not if both are high (to optimize energy use). Which logic gates would you employ for this scenario?

9. **Warehouse Management System:**
   In a warehouse, design a system that triggers an alert if either the stock of an item is below a minimum threshold or if the reorder date is approaching, but not if both conditions are met (to avoid unnecessary alerts). How would you use logic gates to achieve this?

10. **Parking Lot Management:**
    Design a parking lot management system that activates a "Full" sign if either the number of parked cars reaches the maximum capacity or if a VIP event is taking place, but not if both conditions are true (to allow flexibility for VIP parking). Which logic gates will you use and how will you design this system?
